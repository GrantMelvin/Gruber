goals:
- kubernetes resource viewer that doesnt get worse with every update to force a migration to paid subscription (looking at u openlens)
- note taking section that makes sense
- calendar integration so i dont forget stuff
- containerized duh
- zig/html only beacuse i hate my life
- email integration but only if it doesnt break company tos
- some sort of importing from yaml since thats what productivity tracker uses and i have like 5 months of work stuff in yaml for some reason - i am using json this time

ultimate goal is to be able to contribute more to enterprise software and be more efficient (not wait for openlens to update for 45sec every time I want to see logs or load one of my 1 billion clusters)

**no** ai was used to build this
 - i hate ai go away
